# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Comic Quest

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A text based game that allows you to pick certain choices for a charcter that goes through a journey changing the outcome.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our coding will be done using python. The code will utilize nested else if statements along with user inputs. Some features that it will have will contain images that are read into the file and that can possibly move, like for example as the hurrican tracker was able to move we can move our comic in a way. While loops such as while true and also floats will be used to execute our code to make sure that the user follows the text and does not input an invalid character. The game will be in a function and it will be called throughout different functions throughout the different scenarios to concatenate code. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

No

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Khamari Thornton- tul14735@temple.edu - Joanna Nichols
Luis Engleton- luisengleton@temple.edu - Joanna Nichols

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Accepting user inputs and returning scenarios that allows them to continue to reach the end. Incorporating images based on the scenario.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome will be accomplishing a finished story line with some images that illustrate the users choice with a restart button if the user wishes to restart.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome will be a finished story line with images possibly even gifs read into each scenario so it looks like an actual comic and possible some audio included. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Some new skills will be including audio into certain scenarios. We will need to research incorporating images using if statements, while loops, and a greater understandig of how to do a while true loop to make sure the inputs are valid. I will work on the logic of the code and creating the if statements while Luis helps me with that and trys to figure our renpy. Khamari is writing the story and creating some visuals to possibly include.
