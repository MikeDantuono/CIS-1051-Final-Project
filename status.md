Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far we have completed the story line, coded in the logic and nested if else statements as well as implementing a restart button.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We are still working on inserting images and drawing the images. Also if we have enough time we would like to figure out how to implement audio.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The only problem we have encounted is trying to insert the images. We have tried tkinter and a few other methods but have yet to get images to appear.
